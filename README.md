# Uber Data Analytics | Modern Data Engineering GCP Project

## Introduction
This project explores Uber data analytics through modern data engineering practices on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). We'll utilize Mage.ai to build an ETL pipeline, BigQuery for data warehousing, Looker Studio for data visualization, and Cloud Storage to manage data throughout the workflow.
